# 20questions

### Build app
```
yarn
```

### Start server
```
npm start
```

You all set up. Now join `localhost:5000` and play a game.

### Rules
If there's no available games you join as a Riddler - you ask a riddle word. If there are some open games available you join as a Questioner and must guess word in 20 questions. When you think that you know the word, you just can write it down in the field just like question and if you guessed, you win. Every such attempt is counting as a question, so try not to waste them.
